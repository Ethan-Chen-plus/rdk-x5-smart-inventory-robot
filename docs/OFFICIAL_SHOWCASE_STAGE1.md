## Summary

This project designs an RDK X5-powered smart household inventory assistant with a real robotic arm. The target scenario is smart life robotics: the system will perceive household supplies, maintain inventory records, generate low-stock reminders, and later trigger robotic arm actions for simple item interaction, sorting, or demonstration tasks.

For Stage 1, the Magic Box / RDK X5 board was brought up and verified through SSH, Wi-Fi networking, desktop capture, audio device inspection, microphone recording, MIPI camera operation, and BPU-accelerated YOLO inference. The board runs Ubuntu 22.04.5 on aarch64 and is reachable through `ssh sunrise@192.168.127.10`. Wi-Fi networking was verified with successful public connectivity to GitHub.

The AI evidence includes both a static YOLOv5 sample and a live MIPI-camera YOLO pipeline. The live pipeline publishes ROS topics such as `/hbmem_img`, `/image`, `/hobot_dnn_detection`, and `/hobot_dnn_detection_info`, and reports about 29-30 FPS with BPU inference on the `yolo26s_bayese_640x640_nv12` model.

## Technical Highlights

- RDK X5 / Magic Box board running Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS.
- SSH access, Wi-Fi networking, and XFCE desktop screenshot captured.
- MIPI camera live stream verified through MagicBox YOLO demo.
- BPU runtime verified with `BPU Platform Version(1.3.6)` and `DNN Runtime version = 1.24.5`.
- Static YOLOv5 output image generated with detected `kite` and `person` objects.
- Live ROS 2 detection topic verified through `/hobot_dnn_detection`.
- Built-in microphone and speaker devices enumerated; microphone WAV evidence recorded.
